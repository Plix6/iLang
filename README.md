# The concept
A basic language learning app with user accounts to track scores, inspired by Duolingo

# How to try it
- Download the .apk file in the latest release on an Android device
- Run the .apk file to install the app
- The app is installed and ready to run

# Limitations
As the app is using a free API to handle the translations, only a limited amount of requests is supported per day
### What this means :
The translation exercises only work until that limit is reached, and that limit is shared for all the users\
So this means it might only work for a part of the day if many users are doing exercises\
Right now this shouldn't be too noticeable, as the app is not deployed and therefore its scale is minimal
